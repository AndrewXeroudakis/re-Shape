    text: You step into the kitchen, searching for your mug among the piles of unwashed
      dishes and collateral of the graveyard crew.
  - id: makeSomeCoffee_monday_textBlock_1
    text: Beside you, the coffeemaker hisses evilly, as drops of coffee splatter
      onto the heating dish, the pot a casualty of the last going-away party 6 months
      ago.

    text: ~clear~"Shit coffee, shit day," Yazmin's voice comes from behind you and
      you turn, only to see her already plopped on a corner stool, with your mug
      nestled in her cupped hands.

    text: "~clear~\"Don't knock it \u2018til you log in,\" you say as you take back

    text: ~clear~"Jesus wept," you groan, already picturing the rows on rows of desperate
      weirdos piling onto the lines, moaning about their imaginary girlfriends and
      their custom-made homonculi.

    text: You place your freshly washed mug on the cofeemaker's dish as the first

    text: ~clear~"Your girlfriend didn't tell you?" Yazmin says.
  - id: makeSomeCoffee_monday_textBlock_8
    text: ~clear~"Patty's not my-" you begin to say, but Yazmin's already gone.
  - id: makeSomeCoffee_monday_textBlock_9
    text: On the dish, your mug begins to rattle like a dying man's teeth.
