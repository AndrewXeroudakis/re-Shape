    text: You wake your computer up, as soon as you've settled on your office chair.
      It creaks softly under your weight, the sound almost deafening on the almost-empty
      office floor.

    text: Early morning light seeps in from the edge of the horizon, trickling across
      the grey winter sky like honey. From the corridor, you can hear the whooping
      cries of a gaggle of graveyard shifters as they begin to log out with the practiced
      grace of synchronized swimmers.

    text: '"Hey, handsome," goes Patty, one of the graveyard shifters, as she passes
      by your cubicle. You can''t help but smile.'
  - id: officeFloorMonday_paragraph_3
    text: You check your watch, realizing you're half an hour early. You got some
